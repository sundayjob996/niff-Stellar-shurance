//
// GOVERNANCE NOTE: This constant is the only on-chain parameter controlling
// automatic policy deactivation. Changing it requires a contract upgrade and
// cannot be altered by the admin at runtime — removing an avenue for
// admin-only extraction via strike-count manipulation.
//
// LEGAL NOTE: Product/legal must sign off on the strike threshold before
// mainnet deployment. Three rejections is a conservative starting point.
// The threshold intentionally errs toward coverage preservation; false
// positives (legitimate holders de-activated) are harder to recover from
// than false negatives (fraudulent holders retained until human review).
//
// APPEAL INTERACTION: If an appeal window is added later, auto-deactivation
// should be deferred until the appeal deadline passes. Implement by adding a
// `deactivation_pending_until_ledger: u32` field to Policy and skipping the
// `is_active = false` write until that ledger is reached.

// ORACLE / PARAMETRIC TRIGGER STUBS
//
// ⚠️  LEGAL / COMPLIANCE REVIEW GATE: This module contains non-active scaffolding
// for parametric insurance automation.  Do NOT activate in production without:
//   • Completed regulatory classification review (parametric vs indemnity)
//   • Legal review of smart contract-triggered payouts
//   • Game-theoretic analysis of oracle incentivization
//   • Cryptographic design review for signature verification
//
// Compilation guarded by `#[cfg(feature = "experimental")]`.  Default builds
// are cryptographically unable to process oracle triggers (stub panics ensure
// this at compile time).

///   - Replay attack prevention (nonce management)
