# niffyInsure — Event Dictionary

> **Schema version: 1**  
> `SCHEMA_VERSION` in `events.rs` and `events.schema.ts` must stay in sync.  
> Breaking changes (field removed / type changed) → semver-major contract release + `SCHEMA_VERSION` bump.  
> Adding new optional fields is backward-compatible; no bump required.
>
> **Ownership:** the contract author is responsible for updating this file on every contract release.  
> CI enforces that every event name in `events.rs` has a corresponding entry here (see `.github/workflows/ci.yml` — `check-event-dictionary` job).

## Units

| Type | Unit | Notes |
|------|------|-------|
| Token amounts | **stroops** (i128 as string) | 1 XLM = 10 000 000 stroops (7 decimals). Never use floats. |
| Time | **ledger sequence** (u32) | 1 ledger ≈ 5 s on Stellar mainnet. Multiply by 5 for wall-clock seconds. |
| Boolean flags | **u32** (0 / 1) | Matches ABI encoding. `1 = true`, `0 = false`. |
| Addresses | **Stellar address string** | Holder = `G…`, contract/asset = `C…`. |
| Image reference | **FNV-1a u64 hash** | Hash of concatenated IPFS CIDs. Full CIDs stored off-chain. |

---

## Topic layout

Every event has at least two topics:

```
topic[0]  namespace   "niffyins" (claim/admin events) | "niffyinsure" (policy events)
topic[1]  event name  see table below
topic[2+] identifiers claim_id, holder, asset, … (event-specific)
```

The indexer discriminates events by `${topic[0]}:${topic[1]}`.

### `policy_expired` — policy expiry detected

Emitted at most once per `(holder, policy_id, expiry_ledger)` term, either by the
`process_expired` keeper entrypoint or by `renew_policy` when called on an already-expired policy.

## Versioning & migration

1. `SCHEMA_VERSION` in `events.rs` and `events.schema.ts` must stay in sync.
2. A version bump is **required** when any field is removed or its type changes.
3. The `EVENT_PARSERS` table in `events.schema.ts` maps `version → parser`; add a new entry for each bump and keep old entries for historical replay.
4. CI regression tests in `events.test.ts` will fail on shape changes — this is intentional.

---

## What is NOT in events

- Raw IPFS URLs (use `image_hash` to look up off-chain).
- Claim description text.
- Voter lists (derive from `vote_cast` stream).
- PII of any kind.

---

## Read-only entrypoints

These entrypoints are callable via Soroban simulation without authentication.
They perform **no storage reads or writes** and are safe to call repeatedly.

### `version` — deployed contract semver

Returns the semver string stamped at build time from `Cargo.toml` (e.g. `"0.1.0"`).
No events emitted; no state mutation; no auth required.

| Property | Value |
|----------|-------|
| Auth required | None |
| State mutation | None |
| Return type | `String` — pure semver (`MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH`), no network or environment prefix |
| Callable via simulation | Yes |

**Backend usage:** the deployment registry calls `version()` via simulation immediately
after each deploy and records the result. If the returned value does not match the
expected `CARGO_PKG_VERSION` baked into the release artifact, the registry logs an error
and the deploy pipeline should halt and alert.

```
GET /chain/contract-version?source_account=G…
→ { "version": "0.1.0", "minResourceFee": "…" }
```
